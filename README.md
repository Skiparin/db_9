Neo4j was made with the big sample, but the sql took way to long,
so i made it with the small sample.

Neo4j(Depth 5 took too long.):

Depth 1

avg: 0.0036671512500000003 nanoseconds

median: 0.004409404 nanoseconds

Depth 2

avg: 4.157755E-4 nanoseconds

median: 1.7317E-4 nanoseconds

Depth 3

avg: 2.4654905E-4 nanoseconds

median: 1.23321E-4 nanoseconds

Depth 4

avg: 6.521958E-4 nanoseconds

median: 1.16888E-4 nanoseconds



Sql(Only have Avg, didn't have time for median):

Depth 1:

23556336 nanoseconds

Depth 2:

25270272 nanoseconds

Depth 3:

11286680 nanoseconds

Depth 4:

Depth 5:
